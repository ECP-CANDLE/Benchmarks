## Pilot 2 Benchmarks for Molecular Dynamics Simulation Data

**Overview**: KRAS MD Simulation Data

### Benchmark Specs Requirements

#### Description of the Data

- Data source: MD Simulation output as PDB files (coarse-grained bead simulation)
- Input dimensions:
  - Long term target: ~1.26e6 per time step (6000 lipids x 30 beads per lipid x (position + velocity + type))
  - Current: ~288e3 per time step (6000 lipids x 12 beads per lipid x (position + type))
- Output dimensions: 500
- Latent representation dimension:
- Sample size: O(10^6) for simulation requiring O(10^8) time steps
- Notes on data balance and other issues: unlabeled data with rare events
